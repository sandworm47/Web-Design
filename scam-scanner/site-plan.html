      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The last time you made a purchase on Amazon, did you worry about your item’s authenticity? Did you think you could be the victim of fraudulent business practices? If you didn’t, you should. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has stopped caring about vendors on their website. Too often, people are getting fake knockoffs from third party vendors selling through Amazon under the mask of an authentic source. My website cuts through the fog of modern online shopping. With a search as simple and intuitive as Google, you can find out who is selling this item, and where it is coming from.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who shops on Amazon. If you are concerned about getting knockoffs from China, and are a regular buyer on Amazon, then this is for you. Becuase of this website's friendly user interface, it can become second nature to do a quick search. We've made it as easy as possible for new and experienced buyers to find exactly what they are looking for. Even if you don't buy on Amazon that often, it is really easy to hop on over, just to double check.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Why?
People will come to my website to see if they are making smart and safe purchases on Amazon, and to see who the man behind the mask really is. People will come to our website because they want to avoid being scammed. 

What questions will you have?
The questions people will have as they come to our website is, “who is selling me this product?” “Where is this product coming from” and “is what I am about to buy authentic?” 

What can be accomplished?
People will want to be able to figure out the identity of the vendor, and the authenticity of the product. Both of these can be completed with ease at our website.
While this might sound strange, page 1 is a how to. The actual search two will be on page 2. Page one is an instructional how to, because the user finding and providing us the proper serial codes is actually the hardest part 
of the whole process. Page one will explain what the user needs to provide and where they can find, and once they have it, what to do with it. Page one will also explain about how this works, and why. Page one might also include a few testimonials, but I might decide to put that on page 3. 
The information required for the product is easy to find, if you know where to look, and this is key to our services working for you. There are two different serial numbers that you can find in the product description of the item on Amazon. The UPC (108 digit number) and the ASIN (10 digit alphanumerical serial) Both of these serial codes are used by amazon to identify the product, and from our deeper search we can find the seller. If we find the seller, we find the location. From both of these, we use simple logic and cross reference known genuine products to see if any of them ship from the discovered location. If the genuine products and the searched product don’t have the same sources, we know that it is a cheap knockoff.

      <h3>Search Bar</h3>
      <p>
        Page two will include the actual search function, as well and a very simple 3 step graphic that exaplians once again what you need to do. Step 1 – find the serial code. Step 2 – Enter serial code into search bar. Step 3 – Search, and find the answers to your questions! Page two will optimally produce 3 different groups of relevant data. 1 – Who is the actual vendor. Stuff like company name (and who works for the company’s), and vendors license. 2 – Where is the item coming from? While nearly everything comes from China, we aren’t really looking for the source, while that is provided, but its routing. What are the locations its been, soon before shipping? If Apple products are routed through common locations, but your supposed apple product is taking a different path, this is a red flag that your item is coming from an illegitimate third party. 3 – Is my item genuine. While anything ships from everywhere, and anyone sells everything, using logic algorithms, cross references and inventory check, we can see if what you are receiving is legitimate or not.
