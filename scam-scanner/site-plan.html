      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The last time you made a purchase on Amazon, did you worry about your item’s authenticity? Did you think you could be the victim of fraudulent business practices? If you didn’t, you should. Over the past couple of years, Amazon has stopped caring about vendors on their website. Too often, people are getting fake knockoffs from third party vendors selling through Amazon under the mask of an authentic source. My website cuts through the fog of modern online shopping. With a search as simple and intuitive as Google, you can find out who is selling this item, and where it is coming from.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone who shops on Amazon. If you are concerned about getting knockoffs from China, and are a regular buyer on Amazon, then this is for you. Becuase of this website's friendly user interface, it can become second nature to do a quick search. We've made it as easy as possible for new and experienced buyers to find exactly what they are looking for. Even if you don't buy on Amazon that often, it is really easy to hop on over, just to double check.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->
